# Welcome to the GitHub organization page for the US Solutions Development team!

## The US Solutions Development team focuses on (among other things)
* Creating new solutions as part of a US Professional Services engagement
* Educating customers and partners about software development for Axis devices
* Being ambassadors on what can be done beyond the datasheet to Axians and customers alike

## Our Current Approach
* Make repositories.  They're free.
* Repository names and descriptions should contain clues as to what kind of software the repository contains.  ACAP, Component, Example, Tests, so on.  For example, if you are making an airplane tracker ACAP, a good repo name would be ```acap-airplane-tracker```
