# Welcome to the GitHub organization page for the US Solutions Development team!

## The US Solutions Development team focuses on (among other things)
* Creating new solutions as part of a US Professional Services engagement
* Educating customers and partners about software development for Axis devices
* Being ambassadors on what can be done beyond the datasheet to Axians and customers alike

## Our Current Approach
* This approach is subject to change.
* Make repositories.  They're free.
* Repository names should be lowercase
* Repository names and descriptions should contain clues as to what kind of software the repository contains.  ACAP, Component, Example, Tests, so on.
  * Examples
    * if you are making an airplane tracker ACAP, a good repo name would be ```acap-airplane-tracker```
    * if you are making a python example that interacts with VAPIX, a nice name would be ```example-python-vapix```
    * ```tools-slabsuite```
    * ```component-google-maps```
